# Portfolio Projects

This repository contains the Projects section of my personal portfolio. It highlights a collection of beginner-friendly web projects I built while learning the fundamentals of software engineering. Each project focuses on clean layout, responsive design, and user-centered interfaces.

## Included Projects

  A task management interface designed to help users organize daily activities and track progress.

- BloomSpace  
  A responsive landing page created for a wellness brand, focused on calm visuals and simple, modern layout.
